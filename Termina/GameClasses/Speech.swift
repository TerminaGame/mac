        "She always watches us like a dictator. She's probably watching you, too...",
        "Termina wanted to be a movie star at some point, so she tried making her own movie. It tanked pretty badly...",
        "They say that she knows a lot about the universe. I think she knows a little too much for her own good...",
        "Sometimes, she cries in the middle of her room, curled up like a little baby. It's sad, really.",
        "So, we have this guy named Tom around here. He's supposed to be responsible for putting up the paintings on the walls, but when Termina went insane, he just stopped.",
        "A lot of us write on the walls because talking could get us killed. She hears everything, you know...",
        "I once heard she made a whole bunch of us with undeveloped brains and we said the strangest things like 'Cheesecake.' or 'I had my pudding today'. I'm glad we didn't end up like that, because that sounds a tad too basic, right?",
        "I don't mean to tell you your business, but I'd stay the hell away from Termina.",
        "You know, she doesn't have a lot of friends. There's this one guy, though...",
        "I get pretty nervous when Termina starts ranting to herself. She talks about the world being a simulation and that we're all pawns or something.",
        "Termina's clothing preferences are a bit questionable. I don't think dresses mix well with workout pants and sneakers.",
        "We're all pretty sure that Termina's the introverted type, though she does have a single friend. I don't think we really should talk about him because some people around here get triggered hearing his name.",
        "When she's not being the usual insane self, Termina loves to paint. She makes such great artwork, too!",
        "Termina did have an assistant named Craig at some point. Sadly, no one knows what happened to him.",
        "Craig was a cool dude. He helped keep Termina afloat and made all of us happy.",
        "I shudder every time I look at her face. That deformation of hers just scares the hell out of me.",
        "I bet you're the guy that was taken to the safehouse last week. You probably should've stayed there...",
        "Termina once made one of those disappear into thin air and fixed the lights at the same time. We all think of her as a wicked sorceress ever since.",
        "You know, you're kind of like Termina, being able to handle all those errors back there. It seems whenever you take care of them, another problem around here gets solved.",
        "I'm sure if Termina made more friends, she'd be at least a little happier.",
        "I read this book once about a crazy lady that killed everyone and did some weird things that made her feel 'prettier'. I'm glad Termina's not like that; I don't think she even cares about that ghastly thing with her face.",
        "I still remember when Termina made this cute heart bracelet for her friend before she went insane. Man, did he love that thing...",
        "Considering that \"management\" says that we can't write on the walls, Termina writes a lot on her room's walls.",
        "I don't know how she does it, but she somehow builds these crazy machines out of thin air! I call them 'instruments of cyanide', but I'm not sure if they're actually deadly...",
        "Termina's been playing a lot of video games lately. I think she's picking up on some of their messages.",
        "She's not as bad as people make her out to be, at least in my opinion. I think she just hasn't understood the concept of reality.",
        "Sometimes, if someone really ticks her off, she'll start speaking in French. It's the weirdest thing that I've seen.",
        "I wonder if anyone finds it weird when she says this place is her \"masterpiece\". I mean, it's not like she made this place or anything...",
        "I really don't want to talk right now...",
        "..."
