#  Termina for MAS

The files contained in this version of Termina are used to integrate with Game Center. Game Center is a social network provided by Apple for the Apple ecosystem (macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS). Game Center only applies to the Mac App Store, so this directory exists for the Mac App Store-specific version.

Regular release builds are unaffected.

## Building the Mac App Store variant

You'll need to select the scheme **Termina (App Store Release)** to build a version suitable for the Mac App Store.
